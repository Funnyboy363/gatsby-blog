Today my teacher showed me this wierd framework called gatsby
at first I was skeptical, but then i figured out what you could do with it.
I ended up making a blog and now i'm more curious about what it can do.
I like the idea of being able to make a blog, but I'm more interested in the concept. 
Is there something that it can do that bootstrap cannot? Find out next time!
