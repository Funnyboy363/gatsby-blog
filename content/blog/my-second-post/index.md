I looked into the different folders to see what they held. I was annoyed at not being able to find certain things easily. 
I believe that is the point of this assignment. Is to discover things and figure things out on your own.

### Separate post

My son is awesome. I love him dearly. Sometimes I feel like he is my clone. My mini me. I swear he has some characteristics of me.
I wonder if he will be me when he grows up?
